      "Around fourth or fifth grade (in the US, usually around 10 or 11 years old), we learned the concept of a **[least common multiple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiplehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)**. While the problem statement doesn\u2019t use that specific term, it actually contains a pretty decent definition of it: \u201cthe smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers [in a set] without any remainder\u201d. `LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) == 2520` provides a helpful assertion to validate our code before running it on the real problem.\n",

      "The easiest way for me to understand this problem is to apply the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** again and get the prime factorization of each number between 1 and the max in the set, exclusive. In other words, we calculate factors of 2 thru 9 for the example in the problem. Fortunately, we wrote code to do this before in Problem 3 (see `prime_factors()` there)."
